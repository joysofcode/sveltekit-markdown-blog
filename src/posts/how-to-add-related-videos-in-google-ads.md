## What you need to be aware of

Related videos are available in the “Product and brand consideration” and “Brand awareness and reach” goals. You can always bypass these limitations by creating a video campaign without an objective but using the CPV or tCPM bidding strategy.

You can add 2 to 5 videos. You can’t add just one.  
The videos need to be ‘Public’ or ‘Unlisted’.

In order for related videos to appear, the user needs to be using the YouTube app on a mobile device.
