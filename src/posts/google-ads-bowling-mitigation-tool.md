# Google Ads & Bowling mitigation tool


Google Ads has a new policy that states that accounts with 3 strikes will be automatically suspended. The policy also states that when the first strike is issued, the advertiser will have 90 days in order to correct the violation. The account will be considered in good standing if the violations are corrected and the advertiser has also submitted an acknowledgment form.

## When it comes to penalties, the strike system works like this

**Warning**  = No penalties beyond the removal of the relevant ads  
**First strike**  = The account will be placed on a temporary hold for three days, during which ads will not be eligible to run  
**Second Strike**  = The account will be placed on a temporary hold for seven days, during which ads will not be eligible to run. This will serve as the last and final notice for the advertiser to avoid account suspension  
**Third Strike**  = Account suspension for repeat violation of our policies

All of this is pretty scary if you ask me.

** PRETTY SCARY **
