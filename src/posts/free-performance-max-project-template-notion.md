In the column labeled **Date,** you enter the dates each task needs to be completed by. You have the option of a single date or a time period

## What’s the process?

You start by creating the brief with or without the help of the client.

A brief is a document that outlines the objectives, requirements, and guidelines for a creative project, such as an advertising campaign.  
It serves as a roadmap for the creative team and provides a clear understanding of the client’s goals, target audience, messaging, and other essential details.  
The brief typically includes information about the client’s business, competitive landscape, target market, key benefits and features, tone and voice, visual preferences, and other relevant information that can help guide the creative process.

In brief [pun intended], a brief should contain the following

1.  Background information
2.  Objectives and goals
3.  Target audience
4.  Key message
5.  Deliverables
6.  Budget and timeline
7.  Creative guidelines

After creating the brief, you must provide the client with a proposal of your desired actions.  
The proposal should

-   showcase the advertising strategy
-   articulate the creative concepts
-   present the media [copy, static, video, HTML5, etc]
-   envision the desired outcomes

When [hopefully] the client accepts the proposal, then you and/or your team can further develop the strategy for the Performance Max campaign[s].  
After the development of the strategy, the media production, and the copy creation, you can start and build your Performance Max campaign.
