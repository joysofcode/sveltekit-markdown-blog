## Disapproval

Common disapprovals [sitelink]

The following is not allowed

Link text repetition  
Using the same link text for more than one sitelink  
Note: Reusing link text is not allowed even if each sitelink points to a different destination.

Duplicate URLs  
Multiple sitelinks in the same campaign or ad group that point to the same landing page or the same content

Sitelinks that point to the same landing page or the same content  
Examples: Links to different tabs on the same webpage, links to different anchors or fragment identifiers on the same webpage  
Note: Approximately 80% of the content on a page should be unique for that webpage to count as a different destination.

Third-party URLs

Sitelink URLs that don’t match the domain of the ad’s final URL  
Note: While links should normally point to the same domain as the ad URL, we do allow links to point to third-party sites, under limited circumstances. Some examples include links to select online retailers (Amazon, Best Buy), a Facebook page, Twitter account, YouTube video, LinkedIn profile, or Instagram account. In such cases, the link text must be descriptive of what someone would find at the link destination. It should also include the full domain name in the text.

For example, “Watch our video on Youtube.com” should lead to your video on YouTube.

Punctuation and symbols in sitelink extensions

Punctuation and symbols in the link text or description that serve no purpose other than to draw attention to the ad  
Examples: Exclamation marks, punctuation at the beginning of the text, adding a ► symbol
