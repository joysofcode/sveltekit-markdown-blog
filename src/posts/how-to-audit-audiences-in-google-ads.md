By default you should be looking at the columns:

Membership status  
Size:Search  
Size:YouTube  
Size:Display  
Size:Gmail campaign

For ‘Membership status’ the default should be ‘Open’ unless chosen otherwise.  
The duration of each audience should be set to maximum [540 Days].  
For ‘Size:Search’, ‘Size:YouTube’, ‘Size:Display’, and ‘Size:Gmail campaign’ you should look if the size is large enough in order to serve ads.

**Requirements [size]**

**Google Display Network**  must have a minimum of 100 active visitors or users within the last 30 days.  
**Google Search Network**  must have a minimum of 1,000 active visitors or users within the last 30 days.  
**YouTube**  must have a minimum of 1,000 active visitors or users within the last 30 days.  
**Discovery**  ads must have a minimum of 1,000 active visitors or users within the last 30 days.

Jump into the first audience ‘AdWords optimized list’ and have a look at the data inside

You should be seeing the ‘Segment members’, Eligibility, ‘Size’ per network, and ‘Segment Use’.

It should look something like this
