Now allow me to walk you through the template.

## The Notion Google Ads audit template includes



-   ‘ID’
-   ‘Task’
-   ‘Tags’
-   ‘Level’
-   ‘Assigned’
-   ‘Is it required’
-   ‘Difficulty’
-   ‘Outcome’
-   ‘Type of account’
-   ‘Documentation’
-   ‘Impact’
-   ‘Note’

### The most important columns of the template are:

-   ‘Task’,
-   ‘Tags’,
-   ‘Level’.

The important columns will help you conduct a quick audit of a Google Ads Account.  
The rest of the columns should provide assistance and some clarification about the tasks and/or your next steps in order to conduct an in-depth Google Ads Account Audit.


## Template breakdown 

In the upper right corner, you will see the ‘duplicate’ button.  
Click that in order to duplicate the template to your Notion account. If you don’t have an account then you will have to create one.

Afterward, you need to search the ‘**filter**’ button.  
This will allow you to filter out everything you don’t currently need. 

**Google Sheets version** notes

For the Google Sheets veterans out there, the ‘down’ arrows do not offer the same functionality as the ‘filter’ icons.
The ‘down’ arrows will change the property type of the column and have nothing to do with sorting.  
I am only telling this because this is the first thing you will be inclined to press.

Back to the Notion Google Ads Audit template

The ‘Level’ column informs you about the level of the task.  
Eg. ‘Level’ > ‘Account’ will point to things that affect the whole account. This can be anything from bad conversion tags to empty negative keyword lists.

The ‘Tags’ column will inform you about the type of task.  
E.g. ‘Tags’ > ‘Strategy’ will point to things such as Budget

The ‘Task’ column informs you about the question you need to answer by searching for the appropriate data inside the Google Ads Account.

The ‘Assigned’ column will point to the person responsible for carrying out the task. If you do it all yourself then you can hide this column.

The ‘Is it Required?’ column will inform about the weight a task has on the account.  
E.g. ‘Conversions’ need to be enabled in order to understand what is happening in your account and if your ads have the desired effect.

The ‘Difficulty’ column informs you about the complexity of the task.  
E.g. For some CMS, this might not be complex whereas for others you may need the help of developers.

The ‘Outcome’ column is somewhat self-explanatory.

The ‘Type of Account’ informs you about the vertical of the account. I tried to keep it simple to ‘All’ & ‘eCommerce’ simply because some tasks can’t be performed from one vertical to another.  
E.g ‘Dynamic Product Feed’ is not something that usually concerns ‘Leads’ type of accounts.

The ‘ID’ column contains the code for the task. It can be used as a quick reference or part of the ‘Deliverables’ or both.



## Baseline & Benchmark

The first thing you need to do is create a baseline of the account. 
This can be anything from 15000 clicks every February to 0.2 CPC for DSA campaigns.  
However you decide to proceed, you will need to factor in variables and filter out the noise. The noise can be elements that have little to no impact on an account. The variables are elements that directly impact your Google Ads account performance.  
When you have the baseline [for that specific account] established then you can move to the next stage that is setting a benchmark.  
A benchmark can be anything from reducing CPC by 11% to increasing ROAS by 59%.  
As always, **baselines and benchmarks will vary greatly** because no two Google Ads accounts are the same.

This falls under the ‘Strategy’ tag.

## Conversion Tracking

The second most important thing when it comes to Google Ads Account auditing is the implementation of conversion tracking 
ie conversion tags >> conversion actions.  
There are many conversion actions inside a Google Ads account. The actions can anything from purchases to downloads.  
All the conversion actions should have the correct values set. Conversions actions should also have the correct attribution based on your strategy and, most importantly, the needs of the client. 
Also, conversions actions are essential for your ‘Smart bidding’ strategies.  
The template will provide more information about troubleshooting conversion tags.

[How to audit enhanced conversions in Google Ads](https://ppcpanos.com/how-to-audit-enhanced-conversions/)

This falls under the ‘Conversions’ tag and the ‘Account’ level.

## Account Components

The third most important thing when it comes to Google Ads Auditing. 
This can be everything from page feeds to negative exclusion lists to Scripts. Essentially, this is everything you put inside the Google Ads account but affects everything from campaigns to ads to conversions.  
Account components can be anything from easy to extremely hard when it comes to auditing.

Eg Are the URLs inside a Page feed approved today? Will the same be true 30 days from now?

### Ad Suggestions

Ad suggestions are variations of your existing text ads that may boost the performance of your Search Network campaigns.

**Potential Benefits**  
Saves time in creating variations of your existing ads  
Free optimization of ad copy

That said  
Ad Suggestions should be set to “Don’t Automatically Apply” at the account level.  
If this is enabled, suggestions from account notifications will be automatically applied 14 days after the initial notification.

**Instructions**

Sign in to your Google Ads account.  
In the page menu on the left, click Settings.  
Click Account settings at the top of the page.  
Click the drop-down arrow next to “Ad suggestions.”  
Choose Don’t automatically apply ad suggestions.  
Optional: Provide feedback about why you’re opting out of auto-applying ad suggestions.  
Click Save.

Reason being that  
Not all languages are supported  
Sometimes, Machine learning suggestions won’t match the intent of the searcher.  
Removes control from the Marketer

### Auto-Tagging

Auto-tagging is an essential feature

Track conversions on your website on all browsers  
Import conversion data into Google Ads from Google Analytics, as well as other external sources, such as your Customer Relation Management (CRM) system  
Import Google Ads campaign and cost data into Google Analytics reports  
Import Google Analytics site engagement metrics, such as bounce rate and average session duration, into Google Ads reporting

This should be set to “Yes” at the account level

Note  
If the account has a ‘Manual Tags’ setup that would like to continue functioning then you need to ‘allow manual tagging to override auto-tagging’ in Google Analytics

### Call Reporting

Call reporting, which runs on Google forwarding numbers, lets you measure the performance of your call extensions, location extensions, and call ads. You can track details like call duration, call start time, caller phone number for calls longer than 15 seconds (except in India), and whether the call was connected.

This should be enabled if Call Extensions or Website Call Tracking is being used and you meet certain criteria.  

Eg Google forwarding numbers are not available in every country

### Inventory Type

Inventory type identifies the kind of inventory or medium in which an ad serves.  
Inventory types provide an extra layer of control over the content your Video Ads, Display Ads, Mobile App show on.

There are **3 types of inventory**

Expanded inventory  
Standard Inventory  
Limited inventory

You can opt-in to the appropriate ‘Inventory Type’ depending on your services, offerings, and brand safety requirements.

### Excluded Content

Content exclusion settings let you opt-out of showing your ads alongside certain categories of websites, videos, and mobile apps that may not be appropriate for your brand or serve your advertising goals.

There are a variety of content exclusion options depending on the type of campaign. More specifically you can opt out of the following ‘sensitive content’

Tragedy and conflict: Excludes graphic content of combat or war  
Sensitive social issues: Excludes content intended to elicit a response about controversial issues  
Profanity and rough language: Excludes content with infrequent or mild profanity, or profanity used in entertainment, comedy, satire, or music  
Sexually suggestive content: Excludes content about sex or sexual products  
Sensational and shocking: Excludes content of disasters or accidents that show casualties or death

**Note**  
This doesn’t apply to Discovery and Video

### Excluded Types & Labels

This allows us to opt out of showing our ads on certain types of content or digital content labels.

The labels are the following

DL-G: Content suitable for general audiences (can also select “Content suitable for families”)  
DL-PG: Content suitable for most audiences with parental guidance  
DL-T: Content suitable for teen and older audiences  
DL-MA: Content suitable only for mature audiences  
Not yet labeled: Content that hasn’t been labeled yet because they haven’t yet completed the classification process

The Content-type are the following

### Billing Settings

#### Payment Methods

Ensure the payment method hasn’t expired or is about to.  
Consider adding both a backup payment method and a secondary payment method.  
All payment methods should be approved by your payment institution.  
Also, not all payment methods are available in every country.

Learn more about payment methods  
https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2375433

#### Identity Verification

If Google Ads has requested identity verification it is imperative that this is completed within the timeframe dictated by Google Ads. 
Each identity verification will request different documents depending on the type of business and the country of operations.

This falls under the ‘Account Components’ tag.

## Attribution

Attribution is a topic that no one can avoid when it comes to Google Ads and marketing in general. The problem with attribution is that it can provide data that aren’t always true.  
When it comes to Attribution auditing it is best to have a conversation with the client about his marketing efforts besides Google Ads. This will allow you to better understand what attribution model fits that particular account.

Eg If the account is ‘growth oriented’ then ‘first click’ & ‘position based’ are the most appropriate attribution models. Data-driven attribution can be a mixed bag, especially if you running ads from multiple platforms

**TIP**
If you are adamant about changing attribution settings on your conversion actions, you should at least have a look at the attribution section of Google Ads. 

Navigate to **Tools & Settings > Measurement > Attribution ** and you will find the overview section. 
Here you can test the current attribution settings compared to others.  

**TIP**
Go to the Model comparison, change the lookback window to 90 days, choose the dimension you want [choose campaigns for now] and proceed to compare the results in the comparison table.

This falls under the ‘Attribution’ tag.

## Networks

Google Ads has a few options when it comes to Networks and Reach.  
When it comes to Google Ads account auditing, the first thing you need to do is check if the campaigns are running on the appropriate networks.  
Eg BOTF Search campaigns would be best running on Google Search, only.

This falls under the ‘Campaigns’ tag.

## Content Exclusions

Even though not every account holder is considering Brand Safety as an important thing it is good to avoid serving ads on content that might hurt a Brand.

This falls under the ‘Campaigns’ tag.

## Audiences

Audiences are groups of people with specific interests, intents, and demographic information, as estimated by Google. The data used to generate audience segments can be used to improve bidding and targeting.  
That said, audiences can be a lot to manage when you start an audit.  

Below **you will find a Google Sheet with 3 audience lists**

This falls under both ‘Audiences’ & ‘Campaigns’ tags

## Keywords

Keywords allows you to show ads to relevant queries. Quality score is an important part of how effective a is keyword compared to a query combined with an ad.  
The metric fluctuates greatly when tactics like SKAGs, STAGs, SPAGs come into play.  
When it comes to keyword auditing, you need to measure the effectiveness of keywords against the ad, the conversions, and the level of the funnel the campaign is targeting.

This falls under the ‘Campaigns’ tag.

## Quality score

Quality Score is a tool that helps you better understand how well your ad quality compares to other advertisers.

Quality score is based upon 3 components:  

**Expected CTR**  
**Ad Relevance**  
**Landing Page Experience**

Each component is given a score of “Above average,” “Average,” or “Below average.” The score is based on comparisons made to other ads shown for the exact same keyword.

When it comes to Quality Score Auditing, do keep in mind that:  
Quality Score is not a key performance indicator and should not be optimized or aggregated with the rest of your data.  
It’s a diagnostic tool to help identify how ads that show for certain keywords affect the user experience.

This falls under the ‘Campaigns’ tag.

## Bidding

Google Ads gives you several ways to bid for your ads, depending on what matters most to you and your business.  
When it comes to bidding auditing, you will have to determine if the bidding strategy matches both the needs of the business account and that of the data found in the account.

e.g.  
Do you have the necessary conversions in order to engage in ‘Smart bidding’ strategies?

[What is the best bidding strategy when it comes to Google Ads](https://ppcpanos.com/what-is-the-best-bidding-strategy-when-it-comes-to-ppc-advertising/)


This falls under the ‘Strategy’ tag.

## Targeting

Targeting helps your ads reach the right people at the right time on the right device.  
Some Google Ads accounts might have a more conservative approach while others can be a little more ‘relaxed’.  
When it comes to Google Ads account auditing, targeting options can make all the difference as long as the (available) data aligns with the campaign's targeting tactic.

This falls under the ‘Campaigns’ tag.

## Negative keyword lists [NKL]

Negative keyword lists helps you avoid unwanted impressions and clicks across campaigns with minimal effort. Negative keyword lists are easy to manage and even easier to create.  
When it comes to Negative keyword lists auditing, it is always wise to check if the lists are connected to active campaigns.  
Another thing to keep in mind is that Negative keywords work differently for Display and Video campaigns.  
For such campaigns, a maximum of 5000 keywords is considered.

This falls under the ‘Account Components’ tag.

## Negative placements lists

Negative placement lists, essentially, remove your ads from unwanted placements that will hurt both your conversions and your ‘brand’.  
When it comes to Negative placement list auditing you need to consider the following:

Traffic Quality Rating  
Traffic Audience Type  
Content language  
Network Language  
Root domain IP address  
Domain

This falls under the ‘Account Components’ tag.

## Page feeds

Page feeds are used in order to feed Dynamic Search Ads [DSA] with the URLs of the landing pages you want to show up in Google Search.  
It essentially gives you control on the pages Google Ads will serve, to people who search.  
Even though Page feeds are easy to set up, they require someone to create the CSV and upload it.  
When it comes to page feed auditing, you will have to open the feed and check for errors.  
Eg **destination not working**

This falls under the ‘Account Components’ tag.




## Dynamic product feeds

Dynamic product feeds helps Merchant Center showcase your products via Shopping Ads, Free product Listings, etc.  
The dynamic product feed is also required for dynamic product remarketing.  
Dynamic product feeds, besides Merchant Center, have a lot of data requirements.  
When it comes to dynamic product feeds you will need to check the errors found in Merchant Center. 
Eg images to small

## Dynamic Remarketing

Remarketing allows you to show ads to people who have previously interacted with your website and/or mobile app. Dynamic remarketing helps  you scale that with messages tailored to your audience. Even though Dynamic remarketing is fast and efficient, it also requires some technical knowledge in order to set up and work properly.  
When it comes to Dynamic Remarketing auditing, you will have to investigate if the tags are firing properly and if the data returned match that of the business feed and/or product feed.

This falls under the ‘Account Components’ tag.

## Tracking templates

Tagging helps the advertiser better understand how campaigns perform at any given time. Nowadays, tagging is enabled by default in Google Ads. For older accounts, that may not be the case.  
When it comes to Tracking auditing, you will have to make sure that tracking works and returns the ‘appropriate’ data.

This falls under the ‘Account Components’ tag.

## Audience Source

Audience Sources are first-party that allow you to create data segments in Google Ads.  
e.g. Which users reached the checkout page of your store.  
Audience Sources require tags [especially for ecommerce] in order to work properly and populate Audience lists with data.  
When it comes to Audience sources, things like

Tag hits  
Active parameters  
Hits with feed key  
Data segments

will need to be investigated thoroughly.

This falls under the ‘Account Components’ tag.

## Account settings

Account setting is quite possibly the most overlooked panel in Google Ads. Even though it presents you with few options, some of them are extremely powerful and will have an impact on the success of your campaigns and your ‘Brand Safety’ efforts.  
The most important options you will need to audit are:

Tagging  
Tracking  
Inventory type  
Excluded Content  
Excluded types and labels

This falls under the ‘Account Components’ tag.

## Scripts

Google Ads scripts provide a way to programmatically control your Google Ads data using simple JavaScript. Scripts are independent entities that take actions on the user’s behalf.  
There are 2 types of scripts:
 **Single Account Scripts**, and **Manager Account Scripts**.  
What you will need to audit is whether or not the scripts are functional and operational.
Here is a list with some scripts that should be present in most accounts



**List**  [Single account] 
[Account Summary Report](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/scripts/docs/solutions/account-summary)
[Ad Performance Report](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/scripts/docs/solutions/ad-performance)

[Link Checker - Single Account](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/scripts/docs/solutions/link-checker)



Note: there is no script that will do the audit for you but there are scripts that will **indirectly** help you with your audit.

This falls under the ‘Account Components’ tag.

## Rules

Rules help the account manager schedule tasks when a set of specific conditions are met.  
E.g. Pause campaigns when spent reaches a certain threshold  
What you will need to audit is whether the Rules have errors, are unable to run, and/or are ‘Invalid’

This falls under the ‘Account Components’ tag.

## Assets

Assets are individual pieces of content that can be uploaded into an advertiser’s account [besides text assets].  
Assets fall into these categories

Text Assets  
Image Assets  
Youtube Video Assets  
Media bundle Asset

What you need to audit are the quality and the efficiency of the assets connected to active campaigns.

## Extensions

Extensions expand your ad with additional information, giving people more reasons to choose your business. Extension formats include call buttons, location information, links to specific parts of your website, additional text, and more.  
To maximize the performance of your text ads, Google Ads selects which extensions to show in response to each individual search on Google.

The extension types are the following

Location extensions  
Affiliate location extensions  
Callout extensions  
Call extensions  
Sitelink extensions  
Callout extensions  
Structured snippet  
Price extensions  
App extensions  
Lead form extensions

Automated extensions

Dynamic sitelink extensions

Image extensions

Callout extensions  
2 is the minimum in order for callout extensions to show with your ads  
Highlight unique attributes that will increase your CTR

Structured snippets  
12 characters or less are ideal for mobile devices  
Include as many relevant snippets as possible

Lead form extensions  
Qualify potential leads by adding more questions inside your lead form

Call extension  
Consider adding different phone numbers for offerings that vary considerably in value

Price extensions

The most common disapprovals for extensions in Google ads are some of the following

##### Common disapprovals [sitelink]

The following is not allowed

Link text repetition  
Using the same link text for more than one sitelink  
Note: Reusing link text is not allowed even if each sitelink points to a different destination.

Duplicate URLs  
Multiple sitelinks in the same campaign or ad group that point to the same landing page or the same content

Sitelinks that point to the same landing page or the same content  
Examples: Links to different tabs on the same webpage, links to different anchors or fragment identifiers on the same webpage  
Note: Approximately 80% of the content on a page should be unique for that webpage to count as a different destination.

Third-party URLs

Sitelink URLs that don’t match the domain of the ad’s final URL  
Note: While links should normally point to the same domain as the ad URL, we do allow links to point to third-party sites, under limited circumstances. Some examples include links to select online retailers (Amazon, Best Buy), a Facebook page, Twitter account, YouTube video, LinkedIn profile, or Instagram account. In such cases, the link text must be descriptive of what someone would find at the link destination. It should also include the full domain name in the text.

For example, “Watch our video on Youtube.com” should lead to your video on YouTube.

Punctuation and symbols in sitelink extensions

Punctuation and symbols in the link text or description that serve no purpose other than to draw attention to the ad  
Examples: Exclamation marks, punctuation at the beginning of the text, adding a ► symbol

That said, when it comes to auditing, you will have to investigate if the Google Ads extensions are functional, operational, cost-effective, relevant, and connected to the appropriate campaigns and/or ad groups.

This falls under the ‘Campaigns’ tag.

## Ads

Ultimately, Ads are what make or break the performance of a Google Ads Account. Great ads will make the searcher interact with your ads and landing pages. There are multiple types of ads such as text ads, video ads, display ads, shopping ads, discovery ads, etc.  
Ads are a complicated thing to get right for various reasons such as intent, urgency, influence, etc.  
When it comes to auditing you will have to investigate how the ads perform against search terms, intent, and the experience of the searcher and/or audiences

### Campaign Name

The campaign name should accurately describe the purpose of the campaign, the type of campaign, the targeting scope, and the advertising goal[s].  
You should also check a sample in order to validate if the information presented is accurate. 

### Campaign Status

This can be enabled, paused or removed. Check that campaigns that should be running are indeed generating impressions

### Campaign Goal

Campaigns should have the appropriate campaign goals depending on the purpose of the campaign.  
This can be anything from purchases to phone calls.

### Marketing Objective

Campaigns should have the appropriate marketing objective depending on the purpose of the campaigns. 
This can be anything from sales to leads.

### Networks

Generally speaking, if you want control over your ads, you should opt-out of the Search network & Display network. 

### Locations

Check that the locations entered are the correct locations for the campaign goals. You really don't want your ads to target a global audience [All countries and territories] when your business serves a small geographical area.  

### Location Options

Ensure that the target settings under location options are set to the appropriate setting depending on the campaign goals. 
Eg People in or regularly in your targeted locations. 

### Campaign Budget

There should be a sufficient budget for your BotF [Bottom of the Funnel] campaign[s] and the campaign's status should not show “Limited By Budget”. 
If you see that message then your ads aren't showing as often as they should.

More info on "Limited by Budget"  



-   **Where you'll see it**: A bid strategy can have the status "limited by budget" appear in the status column of the campaigns table. This means that your budget is lower than the recommended average daily budget.
-   **Why it appears**: When your budget is below the recommended amount, it's possible that your budget can't accommodate all of the traffic available for your keywords and other campaign targeting settings. To make sure that your budget lasts throughout the day, Google Ads will reduce how often your ads appear. Ads in the campaign can still appear, but might not appear as often as they could.
-   **What it means**: A campaign that's limited by budget can still be successful and help you meet your business goals. But there might be opportunities to gain more exposure if you're able to increase your budget.
-   **What to do next**: Click the budget simulator in the campaigns table to review how much exposure your campaign might receive if you use a different budget. You can also consider lowering your Target CPA or raising your Target ROAS in the limited campaign. Or you can lower your bid adjustment to try to fit more clicks or video views within your budget.



### Bidding

The bidding option should be appropriate to the bidding strategy. 
Manual CPC requires different bidding strategy compared to tROAS and/or tCPA. 
Before you switch your campaigns to a smart bidding strategy you need to be confident that the account has all the data it needs in order to match the desired goal. 

### Dynamic Ad Targets

Dynamic Search Ads should have a page feed for search ads. Page feeds are easier to manage, compared to ‘Google index of the domain’.  
Also, negative targets should not be overlooked. 
Eg you don't want your Dynamic Search Ads to include the checkout page 

### Ad Rotation

Ad rotation should be set to “Optimise: Prefer best performing ads” unless you are testing a new ad variation.

**Do remember that**

Ad Rank considers landing page experience and ad relevance (among other factors) when determining your ad’s position and whether it will show at all. 
A more relevant ad with a better landing page experience could lead to overall better performance.

### Ad Group Name

The ad group name should accurately describe the purpose of the ad group, the type of ad group, the targeting scope, and the advertising goal[s].

### Ad Group Status

This can be enabled, paused, or removed. Check that ad groups that should be running are indeed generating impressions

### Bidding

On campaigns with manual bidding strategies, the bids are set at the ad group level. Ensure that the bid is appropriate compared to the goal.
Eg. you don't want ad groups underperforming due to low bids.


### Targeting Expansion

Targeting expansion should be disabled on display campaigns in order to prevent poor quality impressions and clicks.

### Ad Variations

Each search ad group should have a variety of responsive search text ads with unique headlines and descriptions. These should be regularly reviewed and updated to test well-performing combinations.  
Each display ad group should have a variety of responsive display ads and/or assets.

### Ad Strength

Responsive search ads and responsive display ads should have an ad strength of good, or excellent. 
Ads showing poor ad strength should be updated.  
Consider running experiments in order to ascertain the effectiveness of each ad

### Ad Types

Each search ad group should contain, at a minimum, one responsive search ad and at a maximum, 3. 
**Expanded text ads are now deprecated.**

### Ad Status

This can be enabled, paused, or removed. Check that ads that shouldn’t be running are paused, and ads that should be running are enabled.
eg you don't want Black Friday ads running in April 

This falls under the ‘Campaigns’ tag.
