# How to audit Google Ads Performance Max campaigns [checklist included]


Performance Max campaigns [PMAX] are a new way for advertisers to access all Google Ads inventory from a single campaign across YouTube, Display, Search, Discover, Gmail and Maps.

## **Audit**

Sign in to your Google Ads account  
Click on the PMAX campaign you want to audit  
Click on the “Asset Groups” tab

## **Asset Groups**

In the “Asset Groups” tab, you will be presented with the assets and the audience signals of the ad group.  
Do note that Ad groups are renamed Assets groups in PMAX campaigns.  
Open the Assets in order to audit the titles, descriptions, long descriptions, images, logos, and videos [autogenerated or otherwise].  
If the videos are autogenerated then you should check to see if the slideshows have a good flow between the sentences or, even worse, are not factual at all.  
You can view everything by clicking on the ”View Details’.

## **Audience Signals**

Do note that Audience signals are not audience targeting.  
Audience signals are a way of letting Google know about your ideal customer.  
You could supplement your targeting by adding lower funnel audiences e.g. customer lists.

## **Listing Groups**

The listing groups are the products associated with that specific group. You should audit how many products are ready to serve and how many are not eligible to serve.

## **Extensions**

Extensions should be present in the campaign and/or ad group.  
Locations and Promotions tend to perform exceptionally well.

## **Settings**

**Goals**  
Here you should be seeing the appropriate goal  
e.g. Purchases.

**Customer acquisition**  
Unless you have an explicit order from the account holder about acquiring new customers, you should  **leave the box unticked**.

**Merchant Center feed**  
You should see a feed attached if the account is running eCommerce based ads.

**Country of sale**  
You can’t change that since it is inherited by the Merchant Center

**Budget**  
The campaign[s] should have an adequate budget in order to perform.

**Bidding**  
You choose the appropriate bidding strategy depending on the data and the account goals.  
Maximize conversions and/or Maximize conversion value are, usually, the best options.

**Campaign settings**

**Locations**  
Here you should check if the location settings are correct. The simplest way to find out is to ask the account holder about the area of delivery or the countries they are serving.

**Languages**  
You should be targeting the appropriate language based on the feed and the offerings of the ad account.

**Final URL extension**  
Here you have 2 options.  
“Send traffic to the most relevant URLs on your site” is the best option for most accounts.  
If you want complete control, you should choose the  
“Send traffic to provided URLs only”  
This will allow you to provide specific URLs for the campaign.

Tips on Final URL expansion

Note: Opting out of Final URL expansion isn’t recommended as it may limit the ads served by your campaign.

**Time**

PMAX campaigns need 2 days in order to get approved and as long as 8 weeks in order to exit the learning phase.
