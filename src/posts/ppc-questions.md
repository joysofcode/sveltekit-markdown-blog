# Pay per Click Questions


**Hello, I am Panos and I am a Pay per Click specialist.**

When it comes to PPC [pay per click], clients have a lot of questions. Here you will find most of the PPC questions grouped together. The short and sweet PPC answers range from Google Ads to Facebook Ads to Programmatic and everything in between.  
So, let’s start answering.

## Does Schema affect my PPC performance?

Schema or more precisely Schema markup is a collection of data points that are designed to communicate with bots. All Ad platforms use bots in order to better serve the advertiser and the ad platform.

For free Google Shopping listings [organic], Schema markup will need:

To be present on the landing pages.  
Match the data of the Google Shopping Feed.  
Match the data of the rendered page[s].

If the Google AdsBot can’t find or read the Schema markup found on the landing page[s], then that will generate error messages in Google Merchant Center.

In short, yes, Schema does affect PPC performance, especially in Google Shopping.

## What is a landing page?

A landing page is a webpage a visitor lands after clicking an advertisement or a listing found on the SERPs. Landing pages are the most important part of your PPC strategy. A landing page is a link between the service or product you are offering and the intent of the searcher. The better the link the better the conversions.

There are many elements that distinguish a normal landing page from a high performing one. High performing landing pages load fast on mobile, have good UX, and answer most of a visitor’s questions.

Landing pages can be part of the site or provided by another service such as Mailchimp, Unbounce, Instapage, etc.

## What is A/B testing?

A/B testing is the practice of showing one version or another and tracking the results based on the version the user saw. One version is usually the default version of the page and the other version is often called the ‘challenger’.

A good practice for A/B testing is making serving the user with a ‘challenger’ page that has minimal changes compared to the original landing page. Even though there is no limitation on the changes one can make, the ‘copy’ is the first element that is changed and tested.

Modern WordPress themes provide users with A/B testing ability.

Alternatively, you could use Google Optimize and run A/B tests for free.

## What are KPIs?
