## What is a Meta ADS planner and how does it work

Planners allow us to clarify goals, priorities, and intentions without the limitations of paper. Planners can also be shared with teammates across the globe. In this case, the Meta ADS planner allows you to create and manage the day-to-day tasks of running a successful META ADS account. The tasks can be run by one or multiple marketers.

The META Ads planner template consists of the following sections

So, let’s break down what each section consists of and how it can be used in your day-to-day META ads campaign planning. That said, the template can be duplicated and modified to fit the needs of the marketer and/or the business objectives.
