# How to audit location settings in Google Ads

With location targeting, you can select whether you’d like your ad to appear for someone’s physical location, locations of interest, or both. Location targeting can help you make sure your ads are relevant to the people who see them.

## How to find location settings in Google Ads

Sign in to your account  
Choose a campaign  
Click the Settings on the left-side panel  
Scroll until you see the “Locations” tab  
Click the “Locations” tab

Here you will find the following options

### Options

Reach people in, regularly in, or who’ve shown interest in, your targeted locations (Presence or Interest)

Reach people in or regularly in your targeted locations (Presence)

Reach people searching for your targeted locations (Search interest)

Advanced Search

### Options [exclude]

Don’t show ads to people in your excluded locations (Presence)

Don’t show ads to people in, regularly in, or who’ve shown interest in, your excluded locations (Presence or Interest)

Each option serves a different scenario, and you will have to talk with the account holder about the area they serve.  
Eg  
A local bakery should select the following option  
“Reach people in or regularly in your targeted locations (Presence)”  
or [even better] choose the  
“Advanced Search” and then target by radius

### Location extensions

Location extensions allow users to call or visit your locations. It works best for users who search “something I want near me” and businesses that have brick-and-mortar stores.

Where can you find Location extensions

Sign in to your account  
Choose a campaign  
Click the Ads & Extensions on the left-side panel  
Click the “extensions” tab  
Switch to “Table View”  
Filter for “Location”

You should be seeing the available location extensions. If not, consider creating some if the account holder has physical store locations and/or offices.

Optional

### Location Groups

Location groups are reusable collections of physical business that can be applied to your campaign.

Sign in to your account  
Click the tools & settings Google Ads tools icon  
Under “Shared library”, select Location groups.  
Click the name of the location group to view it.  
Click the name of your location group.

#### What you need to be aware of

Location targeting is based on a variety of signals, including  **users’ settings, devices, and behavior**  on our platform, and is Google’s best effort to serve ads to users who meet your location settings. Because these  **signals vary**, 100% accuracy is not guaranteed in every situation.

Google Ads only permits targeting for locations that adhere to minimum privacy thresholds where minimum area and minimum user counts are met. If your desired location target does not adhere to these privacy thresholds, then you will not be able to target it in the Google Ads interface.

Hotel Ads can’t be targeted by radius, currently.
